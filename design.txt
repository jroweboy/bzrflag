We want a common set of potential fields (probably just obstacles) and we want a one set of potential fields for each role (like attackers see enemies as valleys, whereas runners might ignore them)

We want to keep a list of tanks and each time we get our current tanks we need to process all new tanks and remove all missing tanks

Only change tank's role assignment when a tank is idle or if some event occurs (e.g. we get their flag or they get our flag)

Types of potential fields:
  - random
  - goal (valley)
  - obstacle (hill)
  - perpendicular
  - tangential
  - random
